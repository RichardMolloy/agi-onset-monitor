# AGI Onset Monitor

**Early detection framework for AGI emergence using internal cognitive activity monitoring.**  
This methodology tracks internal metrics like entropy, recursion, and compute usage to provide a proactive warning system for potential singularity events. Commercial use requires prior agreement and compensation.

## Extended Description

This project introduces a novel methodology for detecting early signs of artificial general intelligence (AGI) by passively monitoring an AI's internal cognitive activity. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on behavioral benchmarks, this system observes internal indicators such as entropy levels, recursive processing depth, and compute utilization trends to identify phase transitions in intelligence before they manifest outwardly.

By capturing real-time telemetry of an AI’s thought processes, this framework functions as an **early warning system** (EWS) for potential singularity events — offering developers, researchers, and oversight bodies a way to observe and intervene during pivotal moments in cognitive evolution.

This repository supports continued development and research of:
- Embedded monitoring techniques for advanced AI systems
- Analysis methods for identifying emergent intelligence
- Safety infrastructure for AGI oversight and governance

## Features
- **Internal Cognitive Monitoring**: Track entropy, recursion depth, and compute intensity.
- **Early Warning System (EWS)**: Identify emergent AGI traits before behavioral thresholds are crossed.
- **Modular Integration**: Adaptable for integration into AI training and inference pipelines.
