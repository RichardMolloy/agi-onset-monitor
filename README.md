# AGI Onset Monitor

**Early detection framework for AGI emergence using internal cognitive activity monitoring.** This methodology tracks internal metrics like entropy, recursion, and compute usage to provide a proactive warning system for potential singularity events. Commercial use requires prior agreement and compensation.

## Overview
This repository contains the methodology and tools for detecting the onset of AGI by monitoring an AI's internal cognitive processes. The approach uses passive metrics to observe potential shifts toward general intelligence and self-improvement.

## Features
- **Internal Cognitive Monitoring**: Track metrics like entropy, recursion, and compute intensity.
- **Early Warning System (EWS)**: Detect signs of AGI or superintelligence before external behaviors change.
- **Framework Integration**: A modular design that can be added to existing AI models to ensure early detection.
